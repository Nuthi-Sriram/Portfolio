IntelliProc is a dual proctoring system which uses the laptop webcam and mobile camera to proctor students. It consists of 3 modules - Teacher Module which is used for creating the test and checking the students cheat results. Laptop Module which proctors the students using the laptops webcam and microphone. Mobile Module which proctors the students using the mobile camera.

The application successfully detects all types of malpractices like book, paper, phone, face, laptop detection along with face recognition, and head pose detection. It records the audio throughout the exam duration and also detects tab switching and exiting full screen operation. The mobile proctoring system keeps track of the field of view, which isn't reachable by the laptop webcam. The laptop webcam and mobile camera work, complementing one another. Thus, this dual-camera approach minimizes the chances of a student committing a fraudulent activity by active visual and auditory monitoring.
